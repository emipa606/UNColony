Update of Sadjuuks mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542036108

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md)**.
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the previous version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2019774245).

The old mod has an updated reworked version here:

This mod adds many things to build a new kind of colony.

# 2- UN-Furniture [1.0] : 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2019774854
# 3- UN-Defense [1.0] : 
Defense and turrets = In progress..


For the moment this mod adds :

# 12 generators and 3 solar panels :

- A rustic wood fired generator,
- 3 Fuel Oil generators (Fuel Oil is made in the Fuel Oil refinery),
- 4 Diesel generators (Diesel is made in the Diesel refinery),
- 1 Hydrogen generator (Hydrogen is made in the Advanced refinery),
- 3 solar panels of different sizes, 4X4, 5X3 and 2X7 (good sizes for wind turbines),
- 3 portable generators (2 diesel, 1 Hydrogen).

# Walls, fences, doors, floors and paint :

Warning with the walls : They are higher than the vanilla ones, the texture is not sized the same.
I advice to use the vanilla walls for double walls or walls merged to rocks and mountains.
- Wooden fences, gate, doors, walls and embrasures,
- Steel fences, gate, doors, walls and embrasures,
- Concrete fences, walls and embrasures, cheap and fast to build,
- Shielded doors, walls and embrasures, good for defencive positions,
- Armored doors, walls and embrasures, good for advanced colony,
- Floors with different colors, wooden, steel, concrete and asphal,
- Glass fence and door,
- Paint (Zebra, lines and double lines).

# Item production :

The Metalworking Bench will allow you to produce the most needed but slowly. For more efficiency you have :
- Steel plates : Bessemer Converter, Open Hearth Furnace and Electric Arc Furnace,
- Steel Grids : Metalworking Line
- Steel Tubes : Metalworking Line
- Armored Plates : Metalworking Line
- Basic Components : Assembly Line
- Solar Cells : Assembly Line
- Concrete, paint, glass and asphalt : Construction Machinery
Note the mod will evolve, many things as shell will be produced by the Assembly Line.

# For maximum efficiency, you can improve your production lines with :

- Metalworking Bench + 1 Shaper + 1 Metal Lathe
- Metalworking Line + 1 Shaper + 1 Grinding Machine + 2 Welding Robots
- Assembly Line + 1 Metal Lathe + 1 Milling Machine + 2 Assembly Robots


Note for moders : I use custom8 for paint and custom7 for fences as linkFlags


Hope you will enjoy !
